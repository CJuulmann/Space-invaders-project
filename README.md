# Space-invaders-project
The Space Invaders project is made during a 3 week course on my 3rd semester at the BEng study in course 02321 Hardware/Software programming taught at the Technical University of Denmark.

The project is a software and hardware implementation in C and VHDL of a "modified" Space Invaders game deployed on a FPGA. The hardware modeling of the FPGA is implemented using IP cores which starts from a video input/ouput tutorial provided by Digelint.

Source code related to the software part of the implementation is located in hdmi-in.sdk > HDMI_IN > src

Source code related to the hardware part of the implementation is located in hdmi-in.ipdefs

For a detailed description of the project a final report was written to document the work for the final exam (see pdf file)
